## Making It Yours

All personal information lives in `data/profile.json`. Open that file and update the following:

| Field            | What it controls                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`           | Your full name, shown across all sections           |
| `email`          | Contact email used in footer and CTA buttons        |
| `tagline`        | One-line professional tagline shown in the hero     |
| `description`    | Short description shown in footer and meta tags     |
| `roles`          | Your role title and detailed specializations        |
| `location`       | Country and availability (e.g. India, Worldwide)    |
| `bio`            | Long-form bio shown in the About section            |
| `stats`          | Key numbers: years of experience, projects, etc.    |
| `skills`         | Skills shown in the scrolling marquee               |
| `experience`     | Work history with company, role, bullets, and stack |
| `projects`       | Project cards with title, description, and links    |
| `publications`   | Blog posts or articles you have written             |
| `socials`        | Social profile links (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc.)       |

Website copy that is not personal data (section taglines, CTA text, footer phrases) lives in `data/content.json`. You can leave these as-is or update them to match your tone.

To update colors, open `app/globals.css` and edit the tokens under `:root`. The main ones are `--accent`, `--hero-start`, `--hero-mid`, `--hero-end`, and `--text-primary`.

Update your site URL in `lib/siteConfig.js` before deploying.
